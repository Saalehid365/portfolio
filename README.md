# portfolio
Here is my first portfolio

This portfolio was made via Html,Css and Js

it is very basic and i know that however i have uploaded it to my git so i can keep a track of my progress while i transform into a full time web developer which i am really excited in doing so. 

I aim to a few projects on here and those projects will be based around my life.
